# Heart Disease Risk Prediction

Predictive modeling project using clinical patient data to estimate the likelihood of heart disease.  
Built using R with Logistic Regression, LDA, and QDA.

---

## 🔍 Project Summary
- Built a full modeling pipeline in R (data cleaning → EDA → feature engineering → modeling).
- Implemented **Logistic Regression**, **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**, and **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**.
- Performed 5‑fold cross‑validation and evaluated model performance using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

---

## 📊 Key Results
- **Logistic Regression:** 87.5% accuracy on test set  
- **LDA:** Best sensitivity (88.2%), ideal for medical context  
- **QDA:** Slightly higher overall accuracy than LDA  

📄 Full results, visualizations, and explanation found in the **final report**.
